1.Read the task description
2.Research the services
3.Write the code

!low coupling ad high cohesions - the services are separated from the controller and the controller is focused only on his main purpose
!in the index. html I am including all the links to the different part of my SPA Application (header.html, left-side-bar.html etc.) and by this way 
I am not repeting code => big problem in the programming
